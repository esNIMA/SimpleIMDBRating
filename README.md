# SimpleIMDBRating
This API allows users to sign up, log in, rate movies, and provide feedback. Each movie is fetched from an external API (OMDb) if it doesn't exist in the database. Additionally, when a new critic is added for a movie, other users who have rated the same movie are notified via email.
